<h1>Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model:</h1>
This is my first machine learning project. I have used "Logistic Regression" to train the model to predict whether a person is diagnosed with heart disease or not.  I have used dataset from "Kaggle".  

<h1>Overview:</h1>
This repository contains a project that predicts heart disease using machine learning techniques. The model employs a dataset from Kaggle, which comprises various medical and demographic attributes. We use Logistic Regression to predict whether an individual has heart disease. The trained model is saved using pickle to enable future predictions without retraining.

<h1>Model Details:</h1>
The project uses Logistic Regression for binary classification. Key steps include:
- Importing necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, sklearn), Loading and preparing the dataset, Splitting the data into training and testing sets, Training the Logistic Regression model, Evaluating the model performance and Saving the trained model with pickle.
